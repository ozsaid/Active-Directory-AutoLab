# Welcome to Active Directory AutoLab

After seeing several attempts to create a simulation for students in networking courses.
I decided to pick up the gauntlet and build a solution that would be more elegant and would not require unnecessary installations

The script I am uploading will build a modular environment based on the scenarios I will add later and whose role will be to simulate situations from the daily lives of infrastructure people.

Later I will upload more scripts as well as practice files

I would love to hear enlightening comments
