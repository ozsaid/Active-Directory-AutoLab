# Welcome to Active Directory AutoLab

After seeing several attempts to create a simulation for students in networking courses.
I decided to build a solution that would be more elegant and would not require unnecessary installations

The script I am uploading will build a modular environment based on the scenarios I will add later and will simulate situations from the daily lives of infrastructure people.

Later I will upload more scripts as well as practice files

I would love to hear enlightening comments

The first step it to build the base files for hyper-v
you will need ISO files of SERVER 2019 and Windows 10

run the base scripts after that run the classlab script
and you can start practice the lab files in lab folder

have fun ...
